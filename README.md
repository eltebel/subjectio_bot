## General info

1. Control panel, written in Flask framework, that serves the purpose of managing payloads etc. 
2. A daemon type part, that processes operations posted in the queue and makes a call to Twitter API using python library Tweepy.
The application requires Unix type operating system to run. Recommended OS is Linux Debian.
